# BMI-Calculator
BMI Calculator written in Swift using UIKit

I enjoyed working through this app, from design to completion.
User enters height and weight, then app calculates their BMI based on the UK guidelines for calculating the body mass index.
User receives BMI value with a background colour change depending on result.
